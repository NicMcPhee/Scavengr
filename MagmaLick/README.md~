**Note** 
*There were two variations of this project, one that featured more bug fixes, while the other one has more functionality, but are both nearly identical. I decided to go with the functionality one since there weren't too many bugs to find in the overall project.*

## About The Project

Have you ever gone on a photo scavenger hunt, wondering why it's so awkward and difficult to be able to get everyone's pictures all in one place? Or, have do you have an itch to go out and show the world your photography talent through competition? Well I think this might be your solution...

Scavengr is a photo sharing goal-oriented interface designed for use in an outdoors setting for leaders, educators and those interested in photography.  It features an easy-to-use interface to create hunts and prompts for aspiring photographers and is useful for social engagement and sharing photos.  

Scavengr is based around photo scavenging, and with it, you may be able make an account in order to create photo hunts with associated prompts, as well as add participants through email and make hunt administrators.  The participants (and admins) are able to upload photos to prompts with associated titles and descriptions.   It is based around the idea of social engagement and photography interest.  

Scavengr was made in a software development class at the University of Minnesota Morris in the Spring of 2013. In the end there were two teams left standing, Team MagmaLick and Team PumaEnergySquad, which ended up of both teams being nearly identical in design and code. In the end, it was team MagmaLick's functionality that I chose to incorporate into this repository.

If you want to know more about Scavengr, or are interested in trying it out yourself, watch [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA0Igwc4ZPM "Scavengr About Video") to learn more about it!

## Usage

This is a Groovy/Grails project, so in order to run it, you're going to have to download the groovy/grails tool suite (ggts) if you haven't already.  This project is no longer being hosted on our university's server, so you will unfortunately have to scavenge a server or domain in order to use it properly.

## Development

Scavengr was mostly made with Groovy/Grails with some additions to the javascript and html.  It was made in teams of 3 - 4 on the first iteration, then around 5 - 6 on the second interation, then 7 - 8 on the third, and on the fourth iteration, there were around 10 people on each team.  The project was made for a software design class and so the project was around 8 weeks of work.  This is free to develop for and if you are in the least bit interested, I implore you try it out.  As of right now however, there is no new development being made by the class.
